# LDC 1.23.0 (2020-08-19)

#### Big news
- Frontend, druntime and Phobos are at version [2.093.1+](https://dlang.org/changelog/2.093.0.html), incl. new command-line option `-vtemplates`. (#3476, #3538, #3541)
- Min required LLVM version raised to v6.0, dropping support for v3.9-5.0. (#3493)
- LLVM for prebuilt packages bumped to v10.0.1. (#3513)
- The prebuilt Mac package now also includes prebuilt druntime/Phobos for the iOS/x86_64 simulator, making cross-compilation work out of the box with `-mtriple=x86_64-apple-ios12.0`. (#3478)
- Windows: New `-gdwarf` CLI option to emit DWARF debuginfos for MSVC targets, e.g., for debugging with gdb/lldb. (#3533)
- New `-platformlib` CLI option to override the default linked-with platform libraries, e.g., when targeting bare-metal. (#3374, #3475)

#### Platform support
- Supports LLVM 6.0 - 10.0.

#### Bug fixes
- Fix regression since v1.22: shared druntime potentially overriding libstdc++ symbols and breaking exceptions in C++ libraries. (#3530, #3537)
- Fix naked DMD-style asm emission for non-Mac x86 Darwin targets (e.g., iOS simulators). (#3478)
- `-betterC`: Don't use unsupported EH for handling clean-ups. (#3479, #3482)
- dcompute: Fix wrong address space loads and stores. Thx Rob! (#3428)
- Fix ICE wrt. missing IR declarations for some forward-declared functions. (#3496, #3503)
- Fix ICE wrt. inline IR and empty parameter types tuple. (#3509)
- Fix PGO issues. (#3375, #3511, #3512, #3524)
- Improve support for LLVM's ThreadSanitizer. (#3522)
- Fix linker cmdline length limitation via response files. (#3535, #3536)

#### Internals
- Compiler performance wrt. string literals emission has been improved. Thx @looked-at-me! (#3490, #3492)
- Link libstdc++ statically for `libldc-jit.so` of prebuilt Linux packages, to increase portability. (#3473, #3474)
- Set up Visual D when using the Visual Studio CMake generator, making LDC compiler development on Windows a smooth out-of-the-box experience. (#3494)

# LDC 1.22.0 (2020-06-16)

#### Big news
- Frontend, druntime and Phobos are at version [2.092.1+](https://dlang.org/changelog/2.092.0.html). (#3413, #3416, #3429, #3434, #3452, #3467)
- **AArch64**: All known ABI issues have been fixed. C(++) interop should now be on par with x86_64, and variadics usable with `core.{vararg,stdc.stdarg}`. (#3421)
- Windows hosts: DMD's Visual C++ toolchain detection has been adopted. As that's orders of magnitude faster than the previous method involving the MS batch file, auto-detection has been enabled by default, so if you have a non-ancient Visual C++ installation, it will now be used automatically for linking. The environment setup has been reduced to the bare minimum (`LIB` and `PATH`). (#3415)
- **FreeBSD** x64: CI with CirrusCI is now fully green and includes automated prebuilt package generation. The package depends on the `llvm` ports package and should currently work on FreeBSD 11-13. (#3453, #3464)
- Link-time overridable `@weak` functions are now emulated for Windows targets and work properly for ELF platforms. For ELF, LDC doesn't emit any COMDATs anymore. (#3424)
- New `ldc.gccbuiltins_{amdgcn,nvvm}` for AMD GCN and NVIDIA PTX targets. (#3411)
- druntime: Significant speed-up for `core.math.ldexp`. (#3440, #3446)

#### Platform support
- Supports LLVM 3.9 - 10.0.

#### Bug fixes
- Cross-module inlining (incl. `pragma(inline, true)`): Enable emission into multiple object files. This may have a significant impact on performance (incl. druntime/Phobos) when not using LTO. (#3126, #3442)
- Android: Fix TLS initialization regression (introduced in v1.21) and potential alignment issues. Unfortunately, the `ld.bfd` linker is required for our custom TLS emulation scheme, unless you're willing to use a custom linker script. So `-linker=bfd` is the new default for Android targets. (#3462)
- Casting (static and dynamic) arrays to vectors now loads the data instead of splatting the first element. (#3418, #3419)
- Fix return statements potentially accessing memory from destructed temporaries. (#3426)
- Add proper support for `-checkaction=halt`. (#3430, #3431)
- druntime: Include `core.stdcpp.*` modules. (#3103, #3158)
- GCC-style asm: Add support for indirect input operands (`"m"`). (#3438)
- FreeBSD: Fix backtraces for optimized code by switching to external `libexecinfo`. (#3108, #3453)
- FreeBSD: Fix C math related issues (incl. CTFE math issues) by bringing `core.stdc.{math,tgmath}` up to speed. (dlang/druntime#3119)
- Fix ICE for captured parameters not passed on the LLVM level. (#3441)
- Convenience fixes for RISC-V and other exotic targets. (#3457, #3460)

#### Internals
- When printing compile-time reals to hex strings (mangling, .di headers), LDC now uses LLVM instead of the host C runtime, for proper and consistent results. (#3410)
- One limitation for exotic hosts wrt. C `long double` precision has been lifted. (#3414)
- For AVR targets, the compiler now predefines `AVR` and emits all TLS globals as regular `__gshared` ones. (#3420)
- WebAssembly: New memory grow/size intrinsics. (ldc-developers/druntime#187)
- New `-fno-plt` option to avoid PLT external calls. (#3443)
- iOS/arm64 CI, running the debug druntime & Phobos unittests on an iPhone 6S. Thx Jacob for this tedious work! (#3379, #3450)

# LDC 1.21.0 (2020-04-23)

#### Big news
- Frontend, druntime and Phobos are at version [2.091.1+](https://dlang.org/changelog/2.091.1.html), incl. new CLI switches `-verror-style` and `-HC`, `-HCd`, `-HCf`. (#3333, #3399)
- **iOS** (incl. watchOS and tvOS) support has landed in druntime and Phobos (thanks Jacob!). All unittests are green on iOS/arm64. The prebuilt macOS package includes prebuilt druntime & Phobos libraries for iOS/arm64, for first `-mtriple=arm64-apple-ios12.0` cross-compilation experiments. (#3373)
- LLVM for prebuilt packages upgraded to v10.0.0. Android NDK version bumped to r21. (#3307, #3387, #3398)
- Initial support for **GCC/GDC-style inline assembly** syntax, besides DMD-style inline asm and LDC-specific `__asm`, enabling to write inline asm that is portable across GDC/LDC and corresponds to the GCC syntax in C. See ldc-developers/druntime#171 for examples wrt. how to transition from `__asm` to similar GCC-style asm.  (#3304)
- Inline assembly diagnostics have been extended by the D source location. (#3339)
- **Android**:
  - Revamped druntime initialization, fixing related issues for i686/x86_64 targets, enabling the usage of the `ld.gold` linker (bfd isn't required anymore) as well as getting rid of the D `main()` requirement. (#3350, #3357, ldc-developers/druntime#178)
  - Reduced size for shared libraries by compiling druntime and Phobos with hidden visibility. (#3377)

#### Platform support
- Supports LLVM 3.9 - 10.0.

#### Bug fixes
- Fixed tail calls in thunks, affecting **AArch64** (the debug libraries now work) and possibly other architectures. (#3329, #3332)
- Windows: Do not emit any column infos for CodeView by default (like clang) & add `-gcolumn-info`. (#3102, #3388)
- Windows: Do not leak MSVC-environment-setup into `-run` child processes. A new `LDC_VSDIR_FORCE` environment variable can be used to enforce MSVC toolchain setup. (#3340, #3341)
- Windows: Fix memory leak when throwing exceptions in threads. (#3369, ldc-developers/druntime#181)
- Try to use `memcmp` for (in)equality of non-mutable static arrays and mutable slices. (#3400, #3401)
- `ldc.gccbuiltins_*`: Lift 256-bit vector limit, adding 174 AVX512 builtins for x86; 512-bit vector aliases have been added to `core.simd`. (#3405, #3406)

#### Internals
- `core.bitop.{bts,btr,btc}` are now CTFE-able. (ldc-developers/druntime#182)
- Do not fallback to host for critical section size of unknown targets. (#3389)
- Linux: Possibility to avoid passing `-fuse-ld` to `cc` via `-linker=`. (#3382)
- WebAssembly: Switch from legacy linked-list ModuleInfo registry to `__minfo` section. (#3348)
- Windows: Bundled libcurl upgraded to v7.69.1, incl. the option to link it statically. (#3378)
- Windows: Switch to wide `wmain` C entry point in druntime. (#3351)
- druntime unittests are now compiled with `-checkaction=context`.

#### Known issues
- When building LDC, old LDC 0.17.*/ltsmaster host compilers miscompile LDC â‰¥ 1.21, leading to potential segfaults of the built LDC. Ltsmaster can still be used to bootstrap a first compiler and then let that compiler compile itself. (#3354)

# LDC 1.20.1 (2020-03-07)

#### Bug fixes
- Non-Windows: Revert to strong `ModuleInfo.importedModules` references for correct module constructors execution order. (#3346, #3347)

# LDC 1.20.0 (2020-02-14)

#### Big news
- Frontend, druntime and Phobos are at version [2.090.1+](https://dlang.org/changelog/2.090.1.html). (#3262, #3296, #3306, #3317, #3326)
- Codegen preparations for:
  - iOS/tvOS/watchOS on AArch64. Thanks Jacob! (#3288)
  - WASI (WebAssembly System Interface) (#3295)
- The config file for multilib builds has been restructured by adding a separate section for the multilib target. This avoids `--no-warn-search-mismatch` for the linker and enables support for LLD. (#3276)
- Support for embedding `pragma({lib,linkerDirective}, ...)` in Mach-O object files. (#3259)
  E.g., `pragma(linkerDirective, "-framework", "CoreFoundation");` makes Apple's linker pull in that framework when pulling in the compiled object file.
  ELF object files newly embed `pragma(lib, ...)` library names in a special `.deplibs` section, but that only works with LLD 9+ for now.
- The `ldc-build-runtime` tool has been slightly revised; `--dFlags` now extends the base D flags instead of overriding them. (1200601d44280d5f948a577b444ffa2dd4f9e433)
- `ModuleInfo.importedModules` are now emitted as weak references (except on Windows, for LLD compatibility), following DMD. (#3262)
- Windows: Bundled MinGW-based libs now support wide `wmain` and `wWinMain` C entry points. (#3311)

#### Platform support
- Supports LLVM 3.9 - 10.0.

#### Bug fixes
- Potential stack overflows on Linux in GC worker threads. (#3127, dlang/druntime#2904)
- Support 2 leading dashes (not just 1) in command-line pre-parsing, thus fixing config file section lookup when using `--mtriple` and not ignoring `--conf` and `--lowmem` any longer. (#3268, #3275)
- Support for data directives in DMD-style inline asm. (#3299, #3301)
- Cherry-picked fixes for soft-float targets. (#3292, dlang/phobos#7362, dlang/phobos#7366, dlang/phobos#7377)
- ICE during debuginfo generation for function literals inside enum declarations. (#3272, #3274)

#### Internals
- Misc. tweaks for `dmd-testsuite`: (#3287, #3306)
  - Significantly accelerated by skipping uninteresting permutations.
  - Switch from Makefile to `run.d`, incl. moving LDC-specific exceptions from Makefile to individual test files and support for extended `DISABLED` directives.
- Addition of (recommendable!) Cirrus CI service (incl. FreeBSD) and removal of Semaphore CI. (#3298)
- Some improvements for `gdmd` host compilers, incl. CI tests. (#3286)

# LDC 1.19.0 (2019-12-20)

#### Big news
- Frontend, druntime and Phobos are at version [2.089.1+](https://dlang.org/changelog/2.089.1.html). (#3192, #3210, #3215, #3232, #3242, #3255, #3261)
- LLVM for prebuilt packages upgraded to v9.0.1; our fork has moved to [ldc-developers/llvm-project](https://github.com/ldc-developers/llvm-project). The x86[_64] packages newly include the experimental **AVR** backend. (#3244)
- **Android**: A prebuilt AArch64 package has been added. It also includes prebuilt druntime/Phobos libraries for x86_64; the armv7a package includes the i686 libraries. So all 4 Android targets are covered with prebuilt druntime/Phobos. (#3244)
- Breaking `extern(D)` ABI change for Posix x86[_64]: non-POD arguments are now passed by ref under the hood, just like they already were for `extern(C++)`. Some superfluous implicit blits have been optimized away as well, for all targets. (#3204)
- Posix: Defaults to `cc` now for linking, not `gcc` (or `clang` for FreeBSD 10+) - if the `CC` environment variable isn't set. Override with `-gcc=<gcc|clang>`. (#3202)
- Codegen elision of dead branches for `if` statements with constant condition (not depending on enabled LLVM optimizations). (#3134)
- druntime: New `llvm_sideeffect` intrinsic, new `@cold` function UDA and extended CAS functionality in `core.atomic` (incl. support for weak CAS and separate failure ordering). (https://github.com/ldc-developers/druntime/pull/166, https://github.com/ldc-developers/druntime/pull/167, #3220)
- Windows: Bundled MinGW-based libs have been upgraded to use the .def files from MinGW-w64 v7.0.0. They now also contain a default `DllMain` entry point as well as `_[v]snprintf`. ([libs](https://github.com/ldc-developers/mingw-w64-libs/releases/tag/v7.0.0-rc.1), #3142)

#### Platform support
- Supports LLVM 3.9 - 9.0.

#### Bug fixes
- Misc. CMake issues with some LLVM 9 configurations. (#3079, #3198)
- Equality/identity comparisons of vectors with length â‰¥ 32. (#3208, #3209)
- `ldc.gccbuiltins_*` druntime modules now available to non-installed compiler too. (#3194, #3201)
- Potential ICE when applying `@assumeUsed` on global union. (#3221, #3222)
- `Context from outer function, but no outer function?` regression introduced in v1.11 (inability to access outer context from `extern(C++)` methods). (#3234, #3235)
- Lvalue expressions with nested temporaries to be destructed yielding a wrong lvalue. (#3233)
- druntime: Cherry-picked fix wrt. GC potentially collecting objects still referenced in other threads' TLS area. (dlang/druntime#2558)

# LDC 1.18.0 (2019-10-16)

#### Big news
- Frontend, druntime and Phobos are at version [2.088.1](https://dlang.org/changelog/2.088.1.html). (#3143, #3161, #3176, #3190)
- Support for **LLVM 9.0**. The prebuilt packages have been upgraded to [LLVM 9.0.0](http://releases.llvm.org/9.0.0/docs/ReleaseNotes.html). (#3166)
- Preliminary **Android** CI, incl. experimental prebuilt armv7a package generation (API level 21, i.e., Android 5+). (#3164)
- Bundled dub upgraded to v1.17.0+ with improved LDC support, incl. cross-compilation (e.g., `--arch=x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`). (https://github.com/dlang/dub/pull/1755, [Wiki](https://wiki.dlang.org/Cross-compiling_with_LDC))
- Init symbols of zero-initialized structs are no longer emitted. (#3131)
- druntime: DMD-compatible `{load,store}Unaligned` and `prefetch` added to `core.simd`. (https://github.com/ldc-developers/druntime/pull/163)
- JIT improvements, incl. multi-threaded compilation. (#2758, #3154, #3174)

#### Platform support
- Supports LLVM 3.9 - 9.0.

- Don't error out when initializing a `void` vector. (#3130, #3139)
- druntime: Fix exception chaining for latest MSVC runtime v14.23, shipping with Visual Studio 2019 v16.3. (https://github.com/ldc-developers/druntime/pull/164)
- Keep lvalue-ness when casting associative array to another AA. (#3162, #3179)

# LDC 1.17.0 (2019-08-25)

#### Big news
- Frontend, druntime and Phobos are at version [2.087.1+](https://dlang.org/changelog/2.087.1.html). (#3093, #3124)
  - The upstream fix wrt. [local templates can now receive local symbols](https://issues.dlang.org/show_bug.cgi?id=5710) hasn't been ported yet. (#3125)
- LLVM for prebuilt packages upgraded to v8.0.1. (#3113)
- Breaking change: Init symbols, TypeInfos and vtables of non-`export`ed aggregates are now hidden with `-fvisibility=hidden`. (#3129)
- LLVM 8+: New intrinsics `llvm_*_sat` (saturation arithmetic) and `llvm_{min,max}imum`. Thanks Stefanos! (https://github.com/ldc-developers/druntime/pull/161, https://github.com/ldc-developers/druntime/pull/162)

#### Platform support
- Supports LLVM 3.9 - 8.0.

#### Bug fixes
- Fix for v1.16.0 regression when returning `void` expressions. (#3094, #3095)
- `-lowmem` (and on Windows, `--DRT-*` options) in response files (e.g., used by dub) aren't ignored anymore. (#3086)
- Windows: LDC and LDMD now internally use UTF-8 strings only, incl. command-line options and environment variables. The LDC install dir, source file names etc. can now contain non-ASCII chars. For proper console output, especially to stderr, you'll need Windows 10 v1809+ and may need to set a Unicode console font (e.g., Consolas). (#611, #3086)
- Android: Linker errors when building LDC/LDMD should be fixed. (#3128)
- Support for recent `gdmd` as D host compiler. Thanks Moritz! (#3087)
- Do not require gold plugin when linking with LLD. (#3105)
- Enable linker stripping on FreeBSD (with non-`bfd` linkers). (#3106)
- Some JIT bind fixes. (#3099, #3100)

#### Known issues
- If you encounter segfaults in GC worker threads with shared druntime on Linux that are fixed by disabling new parallel GC marking (e.g., via `--DRT-gcopt=parallel:0` in executable cmdline), please let us know about it: #3127

# LDC 1.16.0 (2019-06-20)

#### Big news
- Frontend, druntime and Phobos are at version [2.086.1](https://dlang.org/changelog/2.086.1.html), incl. a DIP1008 fix. (#3062, #3076, #3091)
- Non-Windows x86: Faster `real` versions of `std.math.{tan,expi}`. (#2855)
- dcompute: New `__traits(getTargetInfo, "dcomputeTargets")`. (#3090)

#### Platform support
- Supports LLVM 3.9 - 8.0 (incl. 7.1).

#### Bug fixes
- Make `pragma(LDC_no_typeinfo)` actually elide TypeInfo emission for structs, classes and interfaces. (#3068)
- Windows: Fix DLL entry point in MinGW-based libs. (https://github.com/ldc-developers/mingw-w64-libs/commit/8d930c129daa798379b3d563617847f8e895f43e)
- WebAssembly: Use `--export-dynamic` when linking with LLD 8+. (#3023, #3072)
- Fix corrupt `this` in functions nested in in/out contracts. (45460a1)

- Improved handling of unsupported vector ops. (a44c78f)
- uClibc: Fix C assert calls. (#3078, #3082)
- Improved error message on global variable collision. (#3080, #3081)

# LDC 1.15.0 (2019-04-06)

#### Big news
- Frontend, druntime and Phobos are at version **2.085.1**, incl. new command-line options `-preview`, `-revert`, `-checkaction=context`, `-verrors-context` and `-extern-std`. (#3003, #3039, #3053)
  - The Objective-C improvements from DMD 2.085 are not implemented. (#3007)
- Support for **LLVM 8.0**. The prebuilt packages have been upgraded to LLVM 8.0.0 and include the Khronos SPIRV-LLVM-Translator, so that dcompute can now emit **OpenCL** too. (#3005)
- Compiler memory requirements can now be reduced via the new `-lowmem` switch, which enables the garbage collector for the front-end and sacrifices compile times for less required memory. In some cases, the overall max process memory can be reduced by more than 60%; see https://github.com/ldc-developers/ldc/pull/2916#issuecomment-443433594 for some numbers. (#2916)
  - Note for package maintainers: this feature requires a recent D host compiler (most notably, it doesn't work with ltsmaster), ideally LDC 1.15 itself due to important GC memory overhead improvements in 2.085 druntime.
- Support for generic `@llvmAttr("name")` parameter UDAs, incl. new `@restrict` with C-like semantics. (#3043)
- macOS: 32-bit support was dropped in the sense of not being CI-tested anymore and the prebuilt macOS package now containing x86_64 libraries only. `MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` for the prebuilt package has been raised from 10.8 to 10.9.
- Prebuilt packages don't depend on libtinfo and libedit anymore. (#1827, #3019)
- x86: SSSE3 isn't required for the prebuilt packages and generated optimized binaries anymore. (#3045)

#### Platform support
- Supports LLVM 3.9 - 8.0.

#### Bug fixes
- Implicit cross-module-inlining of functions annotated with `pragma(inline, true)` without explicit `-enable-cross-module-inlining` has been restored. (#2552, #3014)
- Propagate well-known length of newly allocated dynamic arrays for better optimizability. (#3041, #3042)
- JIT: Support implicit `__chkstk` calls for Windows targets, e.g., for large stack allocations. (#3051)

#### Internals
- Addition of **Azure Pipelines** as CI service. It is the new main CI service and responsible for creating all prebuilt x86(_64) packages. AppVeyor has been dropped completely and CircleCI rededicated. (#2998)

# LDC 1.14.0 (2019-02-17)

#### Big news
- Frontend, druntime and Phobos are at version **2.084.1**, incl. new command-line options `-mixin`, `-{enable,disable}-switch-errors` and `-checkaction`. (#2946, #2977, #2999)
  - Options `-release`, `-d-debug` and `-unittest` don't override preceding, more specific options (`-{enable,disable}-{asserts,invariants,preconditions,postconditions,contracts}`) anymore.
- Linking WebAssembly doesn't require `-link-internally` (integrated LLD) anymore; an external linker (default: `wasm-ld`, override with `-linker`) can be used as well. (#2951)
- Prebuilt Windows packages include LTO-able 32-bit druntime/Phobos too (previously: Win64 only).
- AddressSanitizer support for fibers (requires [rebuilding the runtime libraries](https://wiki.dlang.org/Building_LDC_runtime_libraries) with CMake option `RT_SUPPORT_SANITIZERS=ON`).  (#2975, https://github.com/ldc-developers/druntime/pull/152)
- Support `pragma(LDC_extern_weak)` for function declarations - if the function isn't available when linking, its address is null. (#2984)

#### Platform support
- Supports LLVM 3.9 - 7.0.

#### Bug fixes
- Fix C++ mangling regression for functions with multiple `real` parameters introduced with v1.13, preventing to build DMD. (#2954, https://github.com/dlang/dmd/pull/9129)
- Fix context of some nested aggregates. (#2960, #2969)
- Support templated LLVM intrinsics with vector arguments. (#2962, #2971)
- Avoid crashes with `-allinst` (fix emission of only speculatively nested functions). (#2932, #2940)
- Fix XRay support for LLVM 7+. (#2965)
- AArch64: Fix DMD-style profile measurements. (#2950)
- Be less picky about placement of pragmas (allow intermediate `extern(C)` etc.). (#2599)
- MSVC: Fix `real` C++ mangling to match Visual C++ `long double`. (#2974)
- Fix bad ICE noticed when building protobuf-d. (#2990, #2992)
- Fix ICE when directly indexing vector return value. (#2988, #2991)
- Fix identity comparisons of complex numbers. (#2918, #2993)
- MIPS32 fix for `core.stdc.stdarg`. (#2989, https://github.com/ldc-developers/druntime/pull/153)
- Fix `core.atomic.cas()` for 64-bit floating-point values. (#3000, #3001)

#### Known issues
- Buggy older `ld.bfd` linker versions may wrongly strip out required symbols, e.g., ModuleInfos (so that e.g. no module ctors/dtors are run). LDC defaults to `ld.gold` on Linux.

# LDC 1.13.0 (2018-12-16)

#### Big news
- Frontend, druntime and Phobos are at version **2.083.1**. (#2878, #2893, #2920, #2933)
- The **Windows packages are now fully self-sufficient**, i.e., a Visual Studio/C++ Build Tools installation isn't required anymore, as we now ship with MinGW-w64-based libraries, similar to DMD. Check out the included [README.txt](https://github.com/ldc-developers/ldc/blob/master/packaging/README.txt) for all relevant details. (https://github.com/dlang/installer/pull/346, https://github.com/ldc-developers/ldc/pull/2886, [Wiki: Cross-compiling with LDC](https://wiki.dlang.org/Cross-compiling_with_LDC))
- Debug info improvements:
  * For GDB: printing global and imported symbols, non-member and member function calls. (#2826)
  * For Visual Studio and mago: names, by-value params, nested variables. (#2895, #2908, #2909, #2912)
  * Associative arrays now showing up properly (at least with mago), not as opaque `void*` anymore. (#2869)
  * `-gc` now translates D names to C++ ones, e.g., to use the regular Visual Studio debugger (bypassing mago) and as preparation for VS Code debugging with Microsoft's C/C++ plug-in ([screenshots](https://github.com/ldc-developers/ldc/pull/2869#issuecomment-427862154)). Thanks to Oleksandr for this contribution and the AA fix! (#2869)
- New command-line option `-fvisibility=hidden` to hide functions/globals not marked as `export` (for non-Windows targets), primarily to reduce the size of shared libraries. Thanks to Andrey for stepping up! (#2894, #2923)
- Dropped support for LLVM 3.7 and 3.8. (#2872)
- LLVM for prebuilt packages upgraded to [v7.0.1](https://github.com/ldc-developers/llvm/releases/tag/ldc-v7.0.1).
- Linux: now defaulting to `ld.gold` linker in general, not just with `-flto=thin`, as buggy older `ld.bfd` versions may wrongly strip out required symbols (change with `-linker`). (#2870)
- Improved support for Android/x86[_64], musl libc and FreeBSD/AArch64. (#2917, https://github.com/ldc-developers/druntime/pull/146)
- LDC-specific druntime: `ldc.simd.inlineIR` moved/renamed to `ldc.llvmasm.__ir` (with deprecated legacy alias). (#2931)
- New CMake option `COMPILE_D_MODULES_SEPARATELY` builds D files in the DDMD frontend separately to reduce the time required to build LDC with many CPU cores and/or for iterative development. (#2914)

#### Platform support
- Supports LLVM 3.9 - 7.0.
- Alpine linux/x64: built against Musl libc to support Docker images based on the Alpine distro, requires the `llvm5-libs`, `musl-dev`, `binutils-gold` and `gcc` packages to build and link D apps and the `tzdata` and `curl-dev` packages for certain stdlib modules.

#### Bug fixes
- 32-bit Android/ARM regression introduced in v1.12. (#2892)
- Non-Windows x86_64 ABI fixes wrt. what's passed in registers, relevant for C[++] interop. (#2864)
- Alignment of `scope` allocated class instances. (#2919)


# LDC 1.12.0 (2018-10-13)

#### Big news
- Frontend, druntime and Phobos are at version **2.082.1**. (#2818, #2837, #2858, #2873)
  - Significant performance improvements for some transcendental `std.math` functions in single and double precision, at least for x86. (https://github.com/dlang/phobos/pull/6272#issuecomment-373967109)
- Support for **LLVM 7**, which is used for the prebuilt packages. Due to an LLVM 7.0.0 [regression](https://bugs.llvm.org/show_bug.cgi?id=38289), the prebuilt x86[_64] LDC binaries require a **CPU with SSSE3**, and so will your optimized binaries (unless compiling with `-mattr=-ssse3`). (#2850)
- **JIT compilation**: new `ldc.dynamic_compile.bind` function with interface similar to C++ `std::bind`, allowing to generate efficient specialized versions of functions (much like [Easy::jit](https://github.com/jmmartinez/easy-just-in-time) for C++). (#2726)
- LTO now working for Win64 too; the prebuilt package includes the required external LLD linker and the optional LTO default libs. Enable as usual with `-flto=<thin|full> [-defaultlib=druntime-ldc-lto,phobos2-ldc-lto]`. (#2774)
- Config file: new `lib-dirs` array for directories to be searched for libraries, incl. LLVM compiler-rt libraries. (#2790)

#### Platform support
- Supports LLVM 3.7 - 7.0.
- Windows: Supports Visual Studio/C++ Build Tools 2015 and 2017.
- Alpine linux/x64: built against Musl libc to support Docker images based on the Alpine distro, requires the `llvm5-libs`, `musl-dev`, and `gcc` packages to build and link D apps and the `tzdata` and `libcurl` packages for certain stdlib modules.
- Android/ARM: This release slightly changes the way emulated TLS is interfaced, but is missing a patch for 32-bit ARM. [See the wiki for instructions on patching that file manually before cross-compiling the runtime libraries for 32-bit Android/ARM](https://wiki.dlang.org/Build_D_for_Android).

#### Bug fixes
- Fix IR-based PGO on Windows (requires our LLVM fork). (#2539)
- Fix C++ class construction with D `new` on Posix. (#2801)
- Android: No more text relocations in Phobos zlib, required for API level 23+. (#2822, #2835)
- Declare extern const/immutable globals as IR constants. (#2849, #2852)
- Fix issue when emitting both object and textual assembly files at once (`-output-o -output-s`). (#2847)
- Support address of struct member as key/value in AA literal. (#2859, #2860)
- Fix ICE when computing addresses relative to functions/labels. (#2865, #2867)


# LDC 1.11.0 (2018-08-18)

#### Big news
- Frontend, druntime and Phobos are at version **2.081.2**. (#2752, #2772, #2776, #2791, #2815)
  - Add some support for classes without TypeInfos, for `-betterC` and/or a minimal (d)runtime. (#2765)
- LLVM for prebuilt packages upgraded to v6.0.1. The x86_64 packages feature some more LLVM targets for cross-compilation (experiments): MIPS, MSP430, RISC-V and WebAssembly. (#2760)
- Rudimentary support for compiling & linking directly to **WebAssembly**. See the [dedicated Wiki page](https://wiki.dlang.org/Generating_WebAssembly_with_LDC) for how to get started. (#2766, #2779, #2785)
- **AArch64** (64-bit ARM) now mostly working on Linux/glibc and Android. Current `ltsmaster`/0.17.6 is able to bootstrap v1.11, which can also bootstrap itself; most tests pass. (Preliminary) [CI](https://app.shippable.com/github/ldc-developers/ldc/dashboard) has been set up. (#2802, #2817, #2813)
- LDC on Windows now uses 80-bit **compile-time** `real`s. This allows for seamless cross-compilation to other x86(_64) targets, e.g., without `real.min` underflowing to 0 and `real.max` overflowing to infinity. (#2752)
- New `@naked` UDA in `ldc.attributes` & enhanced functionality for `@llvmAttr("<name>")`. (#2773)

#### Platform support
- Supports LLVM 3.7 - 6.0.
- Windows: Supports Visual Studio/C++ Build Tools 2015 and 2017.

#### Bug fixes
- `extern(C++)` on Posix: Pass non-PODs indirectly by value. (#2728)

- Make GC2Stack IR optimization pass work as intended. (#2750)
- Work around inline assembly regression with LLVM 6 on Win32. The prebuilt Win32 package is now using LLVM 6.0.1 too. (#2629, #2770)
- Fix overzealous check for multiple `main()` functions. (#2778)
- Fix corrupt prefix in integrated LLD's console output. (#2781)
- No context ptr for nested non-`extern(D)` functions. (#2808, #2809)

# LDC 1.10.0 (2018-06-19)

#### Big news
- Frontend, druntime and Phobos are at version **2.080.1**. (#2665, #2719, #2737)
  - No support for Objective-C class/static methods yet. (#2670)
- Breaking Win64 `extern(D)` ABI change: Pass vectors directly in registers, analogous to the MS vector calling convention. (#2714)
- Config file: For cross-compilation, support additional sections named as regex for specific target triples, e.g., `"86(_64)?-.*-linux": { â€¦ };`; see the comment in `etc/ldc2.conf`. (#2718)

#### Platform support
- Supports LLVM 3.7 - 6.0.
- Windows: Supports Visual Studio/C++ Build Tools 2015 and 2017.

#### Bug fixes
- CMake and druntime fixes for DragonFlyBSD, thanks Diederik! (#2690, #2691, #2692, https://github.com/ldc-developers/druntime/pull/138, https://github.com/ldc-developers/druntime/pull/139, https://github.com/ldc-developers/phobos/pull/64)
- DMD-style inline asm label naming issue in overloaded functions. (#2667, #2694)
- Linux: misc. exception stack trace fixes & extensions, incl. default DWARF v4 debuginfo emission with LLVM 6. (#2677)
- Predefine version `D_HardFloat` instead of `D_SoftFloat` for `-float-abi=softfp`. (#2678)
- Bash completion installed to the wrong place with custom `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`. (#2679, #2179, #2693)
- Default to `ld.gold` linker for ThinLTO on Linux. (#2696)
- Fix compilation issues on 64-bit macOS with DMD host compiler â‰¥ 2.079. (#2703, #2704)
- druntime: Fix `core.stdc.stdint.(u)int64_t` on 64-bit macOS etc. (#2700)
- Define `D_AVX` and `D_AVX2` if the target supports them. (#2711)
- Fix sporadic front-end segfaults. (#2713)
- Win64: Fix `extern(C++)` ABI wrt. passing small non-POD structs by value. (#2706)
- Misc. druntime/Phobos fixes and upstream cherry-picks for ARM, AArch64, MIPS etc.
- Fix potential LDC crashes when returning static array results from inline IR. (#2729)
- Win64: Fix terminate handler for VC runtime DLL version 14.14.x.y. (#2739)

# LDC 1.9.0 (2018-04-30)

#### Big news
- Frontend, druntime and Phobos are at version **2.079.1**, incl. new switches `-i[=<pattern>]` (include imports in compilation) and `-Xi`. (#2587)
  - Support a **minimal (d)runtime**. (#2641)
  - Win32 breaking ABI change: add extra underscore for mangled names of D symbols. (#2598)
  - *No* breaking ABI change for 64-bit macOS wrt. C++ mangling of D `(u)long`. It's still mangled as C++ `(unsigned) long` in order not to break `size_t` and `ptrdiff_t` interop, whereas DMD 2.079 mangles it as `(unsigned) long long` (which, in combination with missing `core.stdc.config.cpp_(u)long`, makes it impossible to represent a C++ size_t/ptrdiff_t with DMD 2.079 on 64-bit macOS).
- Support for **LLVM 6**. It's used for the prebuilt packages, except for the 32-bit Windows package (due to #2629). (#2608)
- Integrated LLD (enable with `-link-internally`) now also able to **(cross-)link ELF and Mach-O binaries**, in addition to the existing Windows COFF support. (#2203)
- Prebuilt Linux and macOS packages now ship with **LTO default libs** (druntime & Phobos). Keep on using `-flto=<thin|full>` to restrict LTO to your code, or opt for `-flto=<thin|full> -defaultlib=phobos2-ldc-lto,druntime-ldc-lto` to include the default libs. (#2640)
- When linking against shared default libs, LDC now sets a default rpath (absolute path to the LDC lib dir(s); configurable in the `etc/ldc2.conf` file). (#2659)
- New convenience mixin for fuzzing: `ldc.libfuzzer.DefineTestOneInput`. (#2510)

#### Platform support
- Supports LLVM 3.7 - 6.0.
- Windows: Supports Visual Studio/C++ Build Tools 2015 and 2017.

#### Bug fixes
- DMD-style inline asm:
  - Fix semantics of `extended ptr` for MSVC targets. (#2653)
  - Add missing EIP register. (#2654)
- macOS: Fix install_name and symlinks of shared fat druntime/Phobos libs. (#2659, #2615)
- Make `-static` override `-link-defaultlib-shared`. (#2646)
- Make interface thunks forward variadic args. (#2613)
- Fix `va_arg()` for PowerPC. (https://github.com/ldc-developers/druntime/pull/121)
- MSVC: Support exporting naked functions. (#2648)
- Only emit interface vtables in the declaring module. (#2647)
- Call `_Unwind_Resume()` directly. (#2642)

# LDC 1.8.0 (2018-03-04)

#### Big news
- Frontend, druntime and Phobos are at version **2.078.3**, incl. new switches `-dip1008` and `-transition=<intpromote|16997>` as well as `pragma(crt_{con,de}structor)`. (#2486)
- New switch `-link-defaultlib-shared` to link against shared druntime/Phobos. It defaults to true for shared libraries (`-shared`), so it's primarily useful for executables. (#2443)
- Support for plugins via `-plugin=...` (see [this example](https://github.com/ldc-developers/ldc/tree/master/tests/plugins/addFuncEntryCall)). The mechanism is identical to Clang's LLVM-IR pass plugins and thus supports those as well, e.g., the [AFLfuzz LLVM-mode plugin](https://github.com/mirrorer/afl/blob/master/llvm_mode/afl-llvm-pass.so.cc), [Easy::Jit](https://github.com/jmmartinez/easy-just-in-time). (#2554)
- Support for LLVM IR-based Profile-Guided Optimization via `-fprofile-{generate,use}` (not working on Windows yet). (#2474)
- Basic support for [LLVM XRay instrumentation](https://llvm.org/docs/XRay.html) via `-fxray-{instrument,instruction-threshold}`. (#2465)
- DMD-style function trace profiling via `-profile` (LDMD) / `-fdmd-trace-functions` (LDC). (#2477)
- New UDA `ldc.attributes.assumeUsed` to prevent a symbol from being optimized away. (#2457)
- The PGO helper library `ldc-profile-rt` was replaced by LLVM's vanilla profiling library. Our subset of [LLVM compiler-rt](https://compiler-rt.llvm.org/) libraries is now also shipped on Windows (excl. fuzzer). (#2527, #2544)
- Cherry-picked upstream Musl C runtime support for Docker images based on Alpine and added a native Alpine/x64 compiler, which requires the `llvm5`, `musl-dev`, and `gcc` packages to run and link D apps and the `tzdata` and `libcurl` packages for certain stdlib modules.

#### Platform support
- Supports LLVM 3.7 - 5.0.
- Windows: Supports Visual Studio/C++ Build Tools 2015 and 2017.

#### Bug fixes
- Strict left-to-right evaluation/load order of function arguments. (#2450, #2502)
- Inline asm silently ignores opcodes db, ds, di, dl, df, dd, de. (#2548)
- Missed optimization for `scope` allocated classes. (#2515, #2516)
- Don't eliminate frame pointer by default at `-O0`. (#2480, #2483)
- LLVM complaining about invalid IR pointer arithmetics. (#2537)
- `llvm_expect()` doesn't work with CTFE. (#2458, #2506)
- `.{so,dylib}` file command line arguments should be forwarded to linker. (#2445, #2485)
- macOS: Set shared stdlib install_name to `@rpath/<filename>`. (#2442, #2581)
- `array ~= element` issue if rhs affects the lhs length. (#2588, #2589)
- EH segfaults when checking D class catch handlers against thrown C++ exception. (#2590)

# LDC 1.7.0 (2018-01-06)

#### Big news
- Frontend, druntime and Phobos are at version **2.077.1**. (#2401, #2430)
- **C++ exceptions** can now be caught in D code, for Linux and MSVC targets (and possibly more). A logical step after consolidating LDC's exception handling for non-MSVC targets with DMD's DWARF implementation. (#2405)
- Automated building of release and [CI packages](https://github.com/ldc-developers/ldc/releases/tag/CI). (#2438)

#### Platform support
- Supports LLVM 3.7 - 5.0. (binary packages on GitHub are built with LLVM 5.0.1)
- Windows: Supports Visual Studio/C++ Build Tools 2015 and 2017.

#### Bug fixes
- ICE on chained ref-returning opIndex op-assign. (#2415)
- Windows: `export` visibility ignored for globals. (#2437)
- Print error message when trying to use shared libraries with static runtime. (#2454)
- ldc-1.7.0-beta1 regression: ICE with implicit cast. (#2471)
- CMake: use llvm-config to determine LLVM's cmake directory, if possible. (#2482)

# LDC 1.6.0 (2017-11-26)

#### Big news
- Frontend, druntime and Phobos are at version **2.076.1** (#2362), including `-betterC` semantics (#2365).
- Experimental support for **dynamic codegen at runtime** (JIT-style) to tune performance-critical parts for the used CPU and/or treat special runtime variables as constants. See UDAs `@dynamicCompile`, `@dynamicCompileConst` in `ldc.attributes`; compile with command-line option `-enable-dynamic-compile` and use the `ldc.dynamic_compile` module to generate the code at runtime before invoking it. Congratulations to Ivan Butygin for implementing this non-trivial feature! (#2293)
- Many `std.math` functions are now CTFE-able. (#2259)

#### Platform support
- Supports LLVM 3.7 - 5.0.
- Windows: Supports Visual Studio/C++ Build Tools 2015 and 2017.

#### Bug fixes
- Can't link against wsock32 and ws2_32 on Windows. (#468)
- PGO incompatible with MSVC EH. (#1943)
- Regression: ModuleInfos not emitted as COMDATs. (#2409)
- Incorrect C assert function signature for Android. (#2417)
- Overzealous error check when attempting to evaluate object as constant. (#2422)

# LDC 1.5.0 (2017-10-29)

#### Big news
- Frontend, druntime and Phobos are at version **2.075.1**. (#2252)
- New command-line option `-fp-contract` to control fused floating-point math, as well as about 25 new hidden options influencing codegen, see `-help-hidden` (`-enable-unsafe-fp-math`, `-debugger-tune` etc.). (#2148)
- New command-line option `-linker`. Use `-linker=lld-link` to use an external LLD executable for MSVC targets (with experimental LTO support) or `-linker=<gold|bfd|lld>` for other targets. (#2386)

#### Breaking changes
- Win32: the mangled names of D symbols now start with `_D`, not with `__D`, compatible with DMD. (#2353)

#### Platform support
- Supports LLVM 3.7 - 5.0.
- Windows: Supports Visual Studio/C++ Build Tools 2015 and 2017.

#### Changes to the prebuilt packages
- LLVM upgraded to [5.0.0](https://github.com/ldc-developers/llvm/releases/tag/ldc-v5.0.0-2).

#### Bug fixes
- Cyclic dependencies with `-cov`. (#2177)
- ICE when capturing `this` in constructors. (#1728)
- Objective-C bugs. (#2387, #2388)
- LLVM/LLD 5.0: `-link-internally` broken. ([LLD patch](https://github.com/ldc-developers/llvm/releases/tag/ldc-v5.0.0-2))
- LLVM 5.0: need to build LDC with CMake option `-DLDC_WITH_LLD=OFF` to avoid conflicting command-line options. (#2148)
- LLVM 5.0 & non-Windows targets: names of members in static libraries generated by LDC's internal archiver contain path information. (#2349)
- ~~Workaround for Xcode 9 ranlib bug: don't use internal (LLVM) archiver by default for OSX targets. (#2350)~~ Xcode 9.0.1 fixes that bug, please upgrade.
- Captured lazy parameters may be garbage. (#2302, #2330)
- Packed struct layout regression (#2346) and `T.alignof` not respecting explicit type alignment via `align(N)`. (#2347)
- OSX and Win32: mangling issue for druntime's `rt_options`. (#1970, #2354)
- MinGW Win64: ABI regression wrt. functions returning x87 reals. (#2358)
- Potential file permission problem when copying over LLVM libraries during LDC build. (#2337)
- PPC64: Forward reference error with 1.3 release. (#2200)

#### Known issues
- LLVM 5.0: potentially failing LLVM assertion when emitting debuginfos and using inlining at the same time. (#2361)

# LDC 1.4.0 (2017-09-11)

#### Big news
- Frontend, druntime and Phobos are at version **2.074.1**. (#2076)
- **ldc-build-runtime**: a small D tool that makes it easy to compile the LDC runtime and standard library yourself, for example, to enable LTO-ability/sanitizers or cross-compiling executables and shared libraries for other platforms, like Android/ARM. ([Wiki page](https://wiki.dlang.org/Building_LDC_runtime_libraries))
- @joakim-noah's Android fixes have finally been fully incorporated, enabling every host to (cross-)compile to Android. (https://github.com/ldc-developers/llvm/commit/8655f3208cce28bb7f903cadf5f58a3911392bdc)  [Instructions on using this ldc release to cross-compile D apps for Android are on the wiki](https://wiki.dlang.org/Build_D_for_Android), including how to try out the native Android/arm package, ie a D compiler that you can run _on_ your Android smartphone or tablet.
- Improved support for [AddressSanitizer](https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/AddressSanitizer). LDC will automatically link with the AddressSanitizer runtime library when `-fsanitize=address` is passed (when LDC can find the AddressSanitizer library).
- [libFuzzer](https://llvm.org/docs/LibFuzzer.html) sanitizer support using `-fsanitize=fuzzer` (same as Clang). This flag implies `-fsanitize-coverage=trace-pc-guard,indirect-calls,trace-cmp` and automatically links-in the runtime libFuzzer library if LDC can locate the runtime library. (With LLVM 4.0, there is a dependency on sanitizer runtime, so manually link the ASan library or use `-fsanitize=fuzzer,address`.)
- New `-fsanitize-blacklist=<file>` command-line option to exclude functions from sanitizer instrumentation (identical to Clang). The file must adhere to the textual [Sanitizer Special Case List format](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/SanitizerSpecialCaseList.html).
- New `-fsanitize-coverage=...` command-line option with the same [functionality as Clang](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/SanitizerCoverage.html).
- The config file sections now feature an additional `post-switches` list for switches to be appended to the command line (the existing `switches` list is prepended). E.g., this now allows the user to override the directory containing the runtime libraries via `-L-L/my/runtime/libs` in the command line. (#2281)

#### Breaking changes
- The `-sanitize` command-line option has been renamed to `-fsanitize*`, for clang conformance.
- The semantics of an empty `-conf=` command-line option have been changed from 'use default config file' to 'use no config file'.
- The binary representations of the init values for `float/double/real` have been unified to a special quiet NaN, with both most significant mantissa bits set, on all hosts and for all targets. (#2207)

#### Platform support
- Supports LLVM 3.7 - 5.0. Support for 3.5 and 3.6 has been dropped.
- Windows: Supports Visual Studio/C++ Build Tools 2015 and 2017, incl. the latest Visual Studio 2017 Update 15.3.

#### Changes to the prebuilt packages
- Consistent usage of a [minimally tailored](https://github.com/ldc-developers/llvm/releases/tag/ldc-v4.0.1) LLVM 4.0.1.
- Newly enabled LLVM target `NVPTX` in order to target [CUDA via DCompute](http://forum.dlang.org/thread/smrnykcwpllukwtlfzxg@forum.dlang.org).
- Linux x86_64:
  - Shipping with the LLVM **LTO plugin** for the `gold` linker. On Ubuntu 14.04 and later, `-flto=full|thin -Xcc=-fuse-ld=gold` should work out of the box.
  - Build environment upgraded from Ubuntu 12.04 and gcc 4.9 to Ubuntu 14.04 and gcc 6.3.
- Windows/MSVC: Build environment upgraded from Visual Studio 2015 Update 3 to Visual Studio 2017 15.3.3 (WinSDK 10.0.15063).

#### Bug fixes
- Misc. debuginfo issues, incl. adaptations to internal LLVM 5.0 changes: (#2315)
  - `ref` parameters and closure parameters declared with wrong address and hence potentially showing garbage.
  - Win64: parameters > 64 bit passed by value showing garbage.
  - Win64: debuginfos for closure and nested variables now finally available starting with LLVM 5.0. 
- LLVM error `Global variable initializer type does not match global variable type!` for `T.init` with explicit initializers for dominated members in nested unions. (#2108)
- Inconsistent handling of lvalue slicees wrt. visible side-effects of slice lower/upper bound expressions. (#1433)
- Misc. dcompute issues. (#2195, #2215)
- Potential LDC crashes due to dangling pointers after replacing IR globals (required in some cases if the type contains unions) almost fully mitigated. (#1829)
- Multiple arrayop function emissions. (#2216)
- Potentially incorrect memory layout for unnaturally aligned aggregates. (#2235)
- Wrong `-m32/64` in command-line for external ARM assembler used via `-no-integrated-as`.

#### Internals
- Misc. CI improvements:
  - Addition of high-performant SemaphoreCI (incl. enabled LLVM/LDC assertions).
  - CircleCI upgraded to 2.0, testing with latest gcc.
- Compile all D files for (non-unittest) druntime/Phobos at once. May be disabled via CMake option `COMPILE_ALL_D_FILES_AT_ONCE=OFF`. (#2231)

#### Known issues
- ThinLTO may not work well with the `ld.bfd` linker, use `ld.gold` instead (`-Xcc=-fuse-ld=gold`).
- When building with LLVM 5.0, you may need `-DLDC_WITH_LLD=OFF` in the CMake command line. Otherwise, if the LLD headers are available and LDC is built with LLD integration, the produced LDC binary will refuse to work due to conflicting command-line options.

# LDC 1.3.0 (2017-07-07)

#### Big news
- Frontend, druntime and Phobos are at version **2.073.2**.
- A first experimental version of DCompute for **OpenCL/CUDA** targets has landed. See [announcement](http://forum.dlang.org/thread/zcfqujlgnultnqfksbjh@forum.dlang.org).
- LLVM 3.9+: Experimental integration of **LLD**, the LLVM cross-linker, for MSVC targets. Check out these hassle-free [instructions](https://github.com/ldc-developers/ldc/pull/2142#issuecomment-304472412) to make LDC emit Windows executables and DLLs on any host! (#2142)
- libconfig was replaced by an ad-hoc parser (in D), getting rid of the build and runtime dependency and shrinking the license file by roughly 50%. Thanks again, Remi! (#2016)
- LDC now ships with static and shared runtime libs on supported platforms. (#1960)
- LLVM 3.9+: Static libraries are now generated by LDC (LLVM) by default, not by system `ar` or `lib.exe`. This means that LDC can cross-compile and -archive static libs for all supported targets. Command-line option `-ar` allows specifying an external archiver to be used. (#2030)
- New command-line options `-dip1000`, `-mv` and `-mscrtlib` (#2041).
- Ships with dlang tools rdmd, ddemangle and dustmite.

#### New features

#### Building LDC
- Building LDC requires a preinstalled D compiler.

#### Internals
- LDC now features D unittests itself. Just add some to LDC's D modules and they'll be compiled and executed by CI. (#2016)

# LDC 1.2.0 (2017-04-21)

#### Big news
- Frontend, druntime and Phobos are at version **2.072.2**.

#### New features
- New function attribute `@ldc.attributes.allocSize` (#1610), see https://wiki.dlang.org/LDC-specific_language_changes#.40.28ldc.attributes.allocSize.29

#### Platform support
- Supports LLVM 3.5 - 4.0.
- Exception backtrace robustness has been significantly improved.
- Emission of `reals` with differing precision to the host platform's `real` has been fixed. <br />(The compiler still uses the host platform's D real type to represent compile-time floating-point values, so parsing of literals and CTFE is restricted to the host real precision. For instance, LDC on AArch64 with its quad-precision reals would now make for a universal cross-compiler. On the other hand, cross-compiling from ARM to x86 with 80 bit reals still does not work â€“ for example, `real.max` would silently overflow at compile-time and be emitted as 80-bit infinity.)

#### Bug fixes
- Compilation error with DMD 2.074 host compiler.
- LLVM error when accessing `typeid(null)` (#2062).
- Some LLVM intrinsics not available for LLVM â‰¥ 4.0 (#2037).
- Spurious crashes on OS X user program shutdown when linking against static druntime lib.
- Lexing floating-point literals may fail on PowerPC (#2046).
- LDC crashes when trying to repaint static arrays (#2033).
- No stack trace on Linux (#2004) and Windows (#1976, https://github.com/ldc-developers/druntime/pull/85).
- Generated documentation file is immediately deleted when compiling at the same time.
- LDMD doesn't append default file extension if `-of` option doesn't contain any (#2001, #2002).

#### Building LDC
- Building LDC requires a preinstalled D compiler.

# LDC 1.1.1 (2017-02-23)

#### Bug fixes
- Linux: Always build C parts of standard library as PIC (#2009). This makes the binary packages usable on Ubuntu 16.10 (where executables are linked as position-independent code by default, in contrast to the older system used for preparing the packages).

# LDC 1.1.0 (2017-01-26)

#### Big news

#### Big news
- ARM platform is now a first class target for LDC. It passes most test cases (except 2 failures) and can successfully compile the D version of the compiler.

#### Platform support
- ARM platform is now fully supported. (#1283, #489)
- Preliminary support for AArch64.
- Preliminary support for LLVM 3.9.

#### Bug fixes
- Inline assembly regression with local variable references. (#1292)
- Compile error on Linux/PPC and Linux/PPC64 due to missing import in Phobos.

#### Building LDC
- Linking against LLVM shared library is now supported.

# LDC 0.17.0 (2016-02-13)

#### Big news:
- Frontend, druntime and Phobos are at version **2.068.2**.
- The **exception handling** runtime now **no** longer allocates **GC** memory (although it still uses C `malloc` if there are more than 8 concurrent exceptions or nested `finally` blocks per thread). _Note:_ Creating the `Throwable`s in user code (e.g. `new Exception("â€¦")`) and the `Runtime.traceHandler` may GC-allocate still. (Thanks for this goes to our newest contributor, @Philpax).
- The `@ldc.attributes.section("â€¦")` attribute can now be used to explicitly specify the object file section a variable or function is emitted to.
- The `@ldc.attributes.target("â€¦")` attribute can now be used to explicitly specify CPU features or architecture for a function.
- The `-static` option can be used to create fully static binaries on Linux (akin to the GCC option of the same name).
- `core.atomic.atomicOp()` now exploits LLVM read-modify-write intrinsics instead of using a compare-and-swap loop. As side-effect, the atomic intrinsics in module `ldc.intrinsics` have been renamed:
  - `llvm_atomic_cmp_swap` => `llvm_atomic_cmp_xchg`
  - `llvm_atomic_swap` => `llvm_atomic_rmw_xchg`
  - `llvm_atomic_load_*` => `llvm_atomic_rmw_*`

#### Platform support:
- Improved ARM support. (#1280)
- The compiler now supports NetBSD. (#1247) (Thanks for this goes to @nrTQgc.)
- The float ABI can now be derived from the second field of the triple. E.g. the hardfloat ABI is used if triple `armv7a-hardfloat-linux-gnueabi` is given. (#1253)
- Support for fibers on AArch64.
- Support for LLVM 3.8 and preliminary support for LLVM 3.9

#### Bug fixes:
- make install problem. (#1289)
- When a class contains a union, other fields are not statically initialized. (#1286)
- Compiling DCD with -singleobj causes segmentation fault. (#1275)
- 0.17.0-beta2: Cannot build DCD. (#1266)
- Invalid bitcast error. (#1211)
- 0.16.0-beta1: Trivial program fails on FreeBSD. (#1119)
- Can't build gtk-d 3.1.4. (#1112)
-  x86 ABI: Fix Solaris regression and work around MSVC byval alignment issue. (#1230)
- Atomic RMW operations emit subpar x86 assembly. (#1195)
- align() not respected for local variable declarations. (#1154)
- Codegen optimizations are no longer disabled when `-g` is given. (75b3270a)
- Debug information is now generated for `ref` and `out` parameters. (#1177)
- `core.internal.convert` tests do not depend on `real` padding bytes any longer. (#788)

#### Building LDC:
- LDC now requires LLVM 3.5â€“3.8 and thus also a C++11-capable compiler to build.

#### Internals:
- The LDC-specific parts of the source code have received a big overhaul to make use of some C++11 features and to unify the style (the LLVM style as per `clang-format` is now used).
- The groundwork for a code generation test suite working on the LLVM IR level has been laid, together with some first test cases for alignment issues.
- LDC now emits more optional LLVM IR attributes for more optimization opportunities. (#1232)

#### Known issues:
- LDC does not zero the padding area of a real variable. This may lead to wrong results if the padding area is also considered. See #770. Does not apply to real members inside structs etc.
- Phobos does not compile on MinGW platform.
