This is a standalone (DMD-style) binary package for LDC, the LLVM-based D
compiler.

No installation is required, simply use the executables in the 'bin'
subdirectory. Just make sure that the C compiler (i.e., gcc/clang) is in PATH
when linking (or set the CC environment variable appropriately).

The compiler configuration file is etc/ldc2.conf and can be easily customized
to your liking, e.g., adding implicit command-line options and setting up cross-
compilation.

For further information, including on how to report bugs, please refer to the
LDC wiki: http://wiki.dlang.org/LDC.
