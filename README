LDC â€“ the LLVM D Compiler
=========================

The LDC project aims to provide a portable D programming language
compiler with modern optimization and code generation capabilities.

The compiler uses the official DMD frontends to support the latest
version of D2, and relies on the LLVM Core libraries for code
generation.

LDC is fully Open Source; the parts of the code not taken/adapted from
other projects are BSD-licensed (see the LICENSE file for details).

Please consult the D wiki for further information:
http://wiki.dlang.org/LDC

D1 is no longer available; see the 'd1' Git branch for the last
version supporting it.


Installation
------------

In-depth material on building and installing LDC and the standard
libraries, including experimental instructions for running LDC on
Windows, is available on the project wiki, at
http://wiki.dlang.org/Building_LDC_from_source.

For the impatient, a quick guide for building on *nix systems:

 1) Make sure your system has the necessary prerequisites:
  - a working C++ build environment,
  - CMake,
  - LLVM 3.0+ (3.2 preferred),
  - libconfig++ (http://hyperrealm.com/libconfig/libconfig.html).

 2) Check out the library submodules, if you have not already:
  $ cd ldc
  $ git submodule update --init

 3) Build and install LDC:
  $ mkdir build && cd build  # Out-of-source builds are recommended.
  $ cmake ..
  $ make
  $ make install # Or run LDC directly from the bin/ directory.

 4) Run the test suite to verify your build. Still in the build/ dir:
  $ ctest --output-on-failure -R release -j8  # adjust 8 to cpu count

  # Note: The "-R release" option does speed up testing (so it is
  # used in the CI builds) by filtering for tests with 'release'
  # in their name (see: man ctest). However, for better coverage 
  # (2x more tests, 60% longer to run), ctest without the '-R release'
  # option. -R <regex> is also useful for running just one test
  # quickly.

In case the above steps do not work, please first visit the extended
documentation at http://wiki.dlang.org/Building_LDC_from_source.

Some Linux distributions are also packaging a recent version of LDC,
so building it manually might not be necessary.


Contact
