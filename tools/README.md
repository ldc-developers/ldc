LDC â€“ Tools
===============================

The `/tools` directory contains user tools that accompany LDC and that should be part of LDC packages.

`ldc-prune-cache` helps keeping the size of LDC's object file cache (`-cache`) in check. See [the original PR](https://github.com/ldc-developers/ldc/pull/1753) for more details.

`ldc-profdata` converts raw profiling data to a profile data format that can be used by LDC. The source is copied from LLVM (`llvm-profdata`), and is versioned for each LLVM version that we support because the version has to match exactly with LDC's LLVM version.
